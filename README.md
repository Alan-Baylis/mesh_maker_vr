This is the full source code to Mesh Maker VR.

NOTE: This is the development version of Mesh Maker VR, not the production version. We were in the middle of a massive refactor when we decided to release MMVR as open source, so the code is a lot cleaner than the production code. However, reference images and alignment tools are broken. We were in the middle of re-implementing these as 2.0 versions with additional features. Everything else should work as expected.

# Dependencies

Unity Asset Store Dependencies:
* ProBuilder (free version - I'm pretty sure we're not using this, but it may be required by the scene)
* VR Gimbal Camera (required by the scene, but not really necessary. Feel free to remove it.)
* SteamVR
* Simple Color Picker
* UnityTestTools (necessary to run integration tests)
* The Amazing Wireframe Shader (Note that this takes 30 minutes to compile on a 6700k i7 with 32 gb of ram. I have no idea why. It's a good asset otherwise.)
* TheLabRenderer (I'm pretty sure we're not using this, but it may be required by the scene)
* Free Sunset skybox (skyb1)

This project also requires the CreateThis VR UI project. It's available [here](https://github.com/createthis/createthis_vr_ui) on github. Just copy over the Assets/CreateThis folder into the Assets directory.
