# Dependencies

Unity Asset Store Dependencies:
* ProBuilder (free version - I'm pretty sure we're not using this, but it may be required by the scene)
* VR Gimbal Camera (required by the scene)
* SteamVR
* Simple Color Picker
* UnityTestTools (necessary to run integration tests)
* The Amazing Wireframe Shader
* TheLabRenderer (I'm pretty sure we're not using this, but it may be required by the scene)
